<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Jamiu, Abdullahi</p>

<p>I am a graduate from the University of Ilorin, 
  Nigeria. I studied (Education and Islamic Studies)
  where I obtained my first Degree
  in B.A. Ed. (Islamic Studies).</p>

<p> Although, I Graduated as the Best  Graduating Student 
  in My Department which allows me to be among the top 3% in my
  School 2022/2023 session (UNILORIN), Nigeria. However, my zeal to learn 
  and explore more led me to the Tech World and am willing 
  to give my best in order to achieve my goals.</p>

<p>I have previously learnt Graphics Designs as an undergraduate,
  yet, I prefer being a Full Stack Developer to being a UI/UX 
  designer. Sooner than later, I believe I would become a certified
  Senior Developer in my desired field.</p>
